# 🔥 Hearth

**Identity layer for AI — makes language models remember who you are.**

Hearth injects your memories, preferences, and values into every AI conversation. No more starting from scratch. No more generic responses.

## What it does

- **Identity injection** — Your context travels with you across conversations
- **Constitutional constraints** — Define what AI should and shouldn't do for *you*
- **Memory that matters** — Not just what you said, but who you are

## Status

Developer preview. Chrome extension available for manual installation.
